# Purpose

The objective of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to present a new, unified, and interoperable standard tailored for exchanging microseismic data in mining environments. This RFC seeks valuable feedback and input from industry stakeholders, researchers, and vendors to ensure the robustness and adaptability of the proposed format.

In the current mining scenario, the absence of a standardized data format, combined with the proliferation of proprietary systems, has created barriers to efficient data exchange and integration. This results in potential inefficiencies, increased costs, and limitations in adopting multi-vendor solutions. Given the complexities and unique requirements of mining operations, there's a pronounced need for a format that can accommodate both triggered and continuous data, catering to a spectrum of waveform data types, be it triggered fixed length, triggered variable length, or continuous.

Drawing inspiration from tried-and-tested standards in earthquake seismology, this document introduces necessary modifications to adapt to the specifics of the mining context. The overarching aim is to usher in a comprehensive, open-source standard that promotes consistent and unhindered data interchange across a variety of systems and platforms. Through this endeavor, we anticipate fostering collaboration, improving data analysis capabilities, and paving the way for innovation in microseismic monitoring in mining.
