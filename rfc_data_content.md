# Request For Comment &mdash; Content for &mu;Seismic Data Exchange

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to invite comments on a suggested format to allow standardized and consistent access to the &mu;seismic data collected by mine &mu;seismic system and enable seamless and lossless exchange between different platforms. 

Access to the &mu;seismic data is not consistent between the different vendors, and sometimes between different implementation by the same vendors. There are variations from site to site, often driven by third party requirements. This leads to inefficiencies that make the integration of different systems providing complementary products and services and the usage of data unnecessarily difficult. 

The current document does not propose or prescribe specific format at this stage. This will come later. At this stage, we seek alignment regarding the content of the information transferred, agreement on the container should come at a later stage. Deviation from the previous statement will concern the packaging of the waveforms. Waveforms receive a special treatment because they can be voluminous and there exists significant divergence between the different vendors regarding the nature and packaging. Efficient processing requires the data format to be prescribed.

### Scope

The scope is to define the content and nature &mu;seismic information provided to third parties. This document is concerned with the building blocks and seismic information that are the essence of &mu;seismic monitoring. The information of concern can be classified in three categories:

- **Waveform** &mdash; The raw unprocessed waveform both for the continuous and triggered data.
- **Catalog Information** &mdash; The event information derived from the processing of the waveform data
- **Inventory or System Information** &mdash; This includes the information regarding the instruments (sensor and data acquisition modules) along the data acquisition chain and other information critical to processing the data (e.g., velocity, density and attenuation values or models).

### Rationale

#### Need for a New Standard

Microseismic data plays a important role in ensuring the safety and enabling the efficiency of underground mining operations. While it's one of several essential tools in the arsenal of modern mining techniques, the current scenario of diverse data formats can sometimes complicate seamless integration and analysis.

#### Goal

Acknowledging these subtleties, the proposed data content comes with the following objectives:

-   **Promote Interoperability**: A common content to simplify the exchange, processing, and analysis of &mu;seismic data across a range of systems, championing collaboration and data coherence regardless of vendor distinctions.
    
-   **Promote Innovation**: A harmonized framework can invigorate a healthy competitive land. Vendors are then positioned to focus on elevating equipment quality, finessing data analysis methodologies, and providing top-tier customer support, free from data format nuances.
    
-   **Leverage Established Seismological Standards**: This standard harnesses the strength of existing seismological data formats. While they form the foundational backbone, specific extensions are melded in to meet the unique requirements of the mining industry.
    
-   **Catalyze Technological Advancements**: With a universally endorsed standard, the mining sector is primed to adopt and assimilate breakthroughs in microseismic monitoring and analysis, ensuring continued advancement in safety and operational efficiency.
