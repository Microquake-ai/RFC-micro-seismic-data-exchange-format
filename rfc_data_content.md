# Request For Comment &mdash; Content and Format for &mu;Seismic Data Exchange

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to invite comments on a suggested format to allow standardized and consistent access to the &mu;seismic data collected by mine &mu;seismic system and enable seamless and lossless exchange between different platforms. 

Access to the &mu;seismic data is not consistent between the different vendors, and sometimes between different implementation by the same vendors. There are variations from site to site, often driven by third party requirements. This leads to inefficiencies that make the integration of different systems providing complementary products and services and the usage of data unnecessarily difficult.
